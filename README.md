# darkmode-button-changing-func-and-some-lorem-placeholder

I build this html Lorem page to test the necessary button that needed on an extension project. Single button that changes both its own content as DAY/NIGHT mode and it serves as a hub for an event listener that activates toggles of classes in order to execute darkmode changes. 

The function in the JS file serves as only for the switch/toggle purposes

Single button contains resized SVG vectors that are downloaded from https://www.svgrepo.com/
